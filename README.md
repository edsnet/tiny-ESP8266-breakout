# Tiny ESP8266 Breakout Board

This is a tiny ESP8266 breakout board. I made it because the small breakouts I
bought took up the entire breadboard and didn't include basic pullup/pulldown
resistors.

If you just want to buy the PCB directly, here's [a paneled v1.4
version from Dirty
PCBs](http://dirtypcbs.com/view.php?share=17018&accesskey=47b880c9e762ffa555ab1070dc1a2dde),
which includes 40 breakouts for $14.

Use it however you want, it's under the BSD license, here's what it looks like:

The files are standard KiCad files, go nuts.
