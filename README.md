# Tiny ESP8266 Breakout Board

This is a tiny ESP8266 breakout board. I made it because the small breakouts I
bought took up the entire breadboard and didn't include basic pullup/pulldown
resistors.

Use it however you want, it's under the BSD license, here's what it looks like:

The files are standard KiCad files, go nuts.
