# Tiny ESP8266 Breakout Board

This is a tiny ESP8266 breakout board. I made it because the small breakouts I
bought took up the entire breadboard and didn't include basic pullup/pulldown
resistors.

If you just want to buy the PCB directly, here's [a paneled v1.1
version from Dirty PCBs](http://dirtypcbs.com/view.php?share=15302&accesskey=),
which includes 40 breakouts for $14. I haven't uploaded the 1.4 version yet, but
the only difference is the extra 3V3 output pin from the LDO and somewhat
prettier tracks.

Use it however you want, it's under the BSD license, here's what it looks like:

The files are standard KiCad files, go nuts.
